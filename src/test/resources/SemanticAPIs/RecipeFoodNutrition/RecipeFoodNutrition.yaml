    \ over 365,000 recipes and 86,000 food products. Our food ontology and semantic\
    \ recipe search engine makes it possible to search for recipes using natural language\
    \ queries, such as \"gluten free brownies without sugar\" or \"low fat vegan cupcakes.\"\
    \ You can automatically calculate the nutritional information for any recipe,\
    \ analyze recipe costs, visualize ingredient lists, find recipes for what's in\
    \ your fridge, find recipes based on special diets, nutritional requirements,\
    \ or favorite ingredients, classify recipes into types and cuisines, convert ingredient\
    \ amounts, or even compute an entire meal plan. With our powerful API, you can\
    \ create many kinds of food and especially nutrition apps.\r\n\r\nSpecial diets/dietary\
    \ requirements currently available include: vegan, vegetarian, pescetarian, gluten\
    \ free, grain free, dairy free, high protein, low sodium, low carb, Paleo, Primal,\
    \ ketogenic, FODMAP, and Whole 30. We will soon be adding Weight Watcher points,\
