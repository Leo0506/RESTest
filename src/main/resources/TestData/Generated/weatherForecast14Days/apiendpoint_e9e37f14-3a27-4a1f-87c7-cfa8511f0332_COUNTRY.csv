ref|The name of the country equivalent to modern Zimbabwe changed numerous times during the history of the Rhodesian African Rifles. Following the independence of Northern Rhodesia as Zambia in 1964, the Southern Rhodesian government announced that it would drop "Southern" and henceforth call the country Rhodesia. Britain ruled this invalid. The colony issued the Unilateral Declaration of Independence as Rhodesia and used that name until becoming Zimbabwe Rhodesia in 1979; the UK continued to use Southern Rhodesia throughout this time. The name "Zimbabwe" was adopted on internationally recognised independence in April 1980.
