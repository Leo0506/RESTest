* Make sure you have installed Allure in your root path. To do so, you can [download the zip package from Maven](http://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/io/qameta/allure/allure-commandline/2.12.1/allure-commandline-2.12.1.zip), uncompress it and change the folder names to ```.allure/allure-2.3.1/[...]```.
